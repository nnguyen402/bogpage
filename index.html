                Hello my name is Nathan Nguyen and I am a Vietnamese American
                from Lawrenceville, Georgia! I am a third year majoring in Computer Science with a 
                thread focus in Media and Information Internetworks. When I can, I enjoy
                helping those who are less fortunate whether that's volunteering at a foodbank
                or donating. I also enjoy doing photography in my freetime to take pictures of friends
                or random people I may meet to post them online.
